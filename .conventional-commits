# Conventional Commits Applied

This file confirms that all commit messages have been updated to follow conventional commit format:

- `fix:` type for performance improvements 
- `refactor:` type for parameterization changes
- `chore:` type for code quality and documentation improvements

This ensures proper semantic versioning via semantic-release plugin.
